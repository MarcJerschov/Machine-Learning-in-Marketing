After cleaning the data using a combination of critical thinking, the z-score method, and the IQR-Distance method, I proceeded with a systematic exploration process. Adhering to the Crisp-DM framework, I engaged in feature engineering, standardized the data, and generated derived variables, ratios, and percentiles. Subsequently, I analyzed the data to determine the optimal number of clusters. To achieve this, I employed hierarchical clustering with various methods and distance concepts, while also exploring the Elbow method and silhouette method for guidance. I further conducted k-means clustering exclusively utilizing customer-based variables. To account for the categorical variables not utilized in the Cluster Analysis, I conducted a Correspondence Analysis, mapping the Clusters against these variables. Additionally, I performed a second-order clustering analysis using product-based variables, examining the combination of clusters. In the end, I successfully identified three distinct and Ill-defined clusters.

In the second phase of the project, our focus shifted towards developing a classification model to predict the number of customers to target for a new marketing campaign. To facilitate this, I introduced a newly derived variable called “monetary.” I proceeded to create two sets of models: one incorporating the derived variable and another without it.
I then explored a range of different models, including KNN, SVM, Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Balanced Random Forest. By comparing the performance of these models against each other and the second set of models, I aimed to identify the most effective approach. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using Grid- search techniques to optimize model performance.
